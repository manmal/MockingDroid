What is MockingDroid?
MockingDroid is a VERY SMALL template app for interactive mockups on Android, for performing usability tests and getting a feeling of how well your UI ideas work out.
It works by presenting HTML files which are present in the assets folder (or alternatively, online), which can
be structured like ordinary HTML, including hyperlinks, stylesheets, images,...

Features:
- You stay in full control of your mockups - use plain HTML.
- Screen-resolution independent - scaling happens automatically via the WebView's zoom factor (as long as all pages are same width, have a look at Requirements).
- Back-button works; if user has reached start.html, the backbutton exits the application, as expected.
- Resuming the app after passivation works as expected, returning to the last viewed screen

Requirements:
- "start.html" must be present in the project's assets folder - this is the first screen a user sees upon starting the app;
alternatively, you can set another path in /res/values/settings.xml
- The setting mockups_width in /res/values/settings.xml (default at 400px) should equal the width of all mockup pages (have a look at the two sample pages, where image width is set to 400px via style.css).

Usage Instructions:
1. Clone source into a directory
1.b. Get the Android SDK and Tools
2. Copy your mockup's HTML structure into /assets (have a look at the sample files there).
3. Adjust settings /res/values/settings.xml - set the standard page width of your mockups (usually the width of images, can also be a scaled size set in CSS), and the path to the starting page.
4. If you use any online HTML resources, add permission "android.permission.INTERNET" to AndroidManifest.xml
5. Run (tested only at API Level 8 [Android 2.2])

Not yet implemented:
- Menu button functionality (e.g. by loading corresponding file xy_menu.html, if the current view is xy.html)
